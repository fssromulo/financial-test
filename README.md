## Features

I would like to Highlights some points of this project:

-  Authentication with Firebase;
-  It's using Real Time Database from Google to store user's data;
-  It was code with Vue 3 in Vite, Typescript and Vuetify;
-  I don't have enought time to improve my code with unit test.
-  I've used AWS amplify to deploy it;
